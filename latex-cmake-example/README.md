Purpose
-------

Use cmake to compile latex files.

Test Environment
----------------

* Gentoo Linux (with noto-cjk installed for CJK fonts)
* TeXLive 2017
* cmake 2.8+

How to use
----------

Put [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and [UseLATEX.cmake](UseLATEX.cmake)
together with your latex files, modify CMakeLists.txt to match your project,
and run the following commands:

```
#!/bin/sh
mkdir out
cd out
cmake .. -DPDFLATEX_COMPILER=$(which xelatex)
make VERBOSE=1  # VERBOSE mode for indicating what may go wrong.
cd -
```

The directory "out" contains all intermediate files, including the final pdf, that are generated by latex.
