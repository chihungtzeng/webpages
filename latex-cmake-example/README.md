Purpose
-------

Use cmake to compile latex files.

How to use
----------

Put CMakeLists.txt together with your
latex files, modify CMakeLists.txt to match your project, and run the
following commands:

```
#!/bin/sh
mkdir out
cd out
cmake .. -DPDFLATEX_COMPILER=$(which xelatex)
make VERBOSE=1  # VERBOSE mode for indicating what may go wrong.
cd -
```

The directory "out" contains all intermediate files, including the final pdf, that are generated by latex.
