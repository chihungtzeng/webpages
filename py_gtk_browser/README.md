### Introduction

It is a toy [program](gtk_browser.py) that uses Gtk python binding to launch a (customized) browser. To demo it, use [countdown.html](countdown.html)

### Motivation

I want to put a countdown clock in my desktop to remind me of the limited
time resource. I was lazy to learn gtk programming, which might be
time-consuming. Therefore, I ended up using pygtk to do this.

PS: Empirical evidence shows that I am not bother to take a look of the countdown clock (evil simile), but I think the program is tiny enough and could be used for the purpose of education.
